      <p>A proposed bill by the New York City Council Committee on Finance to extend the city’s tax lien sales program until 2024 could put about 350 properties in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, at risk of foreclosure. The law backing the program is
        set to expire on Dec. 31. </p>
      <p>As of Dec. 9, these properties’ liens are ready to be sold off on the 2020 list, according to the city’s Department of Finance. Of the five boroughs, Brooklyn has the most liens remaining in this year’s sale, with 1,358 properties.</p>
      <p>The tax lien sale, established in 1996 as a revenue source for the city, is a yearly sale of outstanding property tax, water and sewage debts owed by homeowners. The debt is sold by the Department of Finance to non-profit trusts, which the
        buyer now has to pay or have their home legally foreclosed.</p>
      <p>“The tax water lien law has been something that has affected our community in a negative way,” Henry Butler, the district manager of Brooklyn’s community board 3 said at a Dec. 7 meeting. “I feel like that law should expire. We should not be
        taking people’s properties that’s worth $1 million because they fell behind on a couple of thousands of dollars on their tax or water bill.”
      </p>
      <p>The sale of the 2020 tax lien list was originally scheduled for May and was delayed twice by Mayor Bill de Blasio , then most recently by Gov. Andrew Cuomo until Jan. 1, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <p> The mayor’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>
      <p> Council member Robert Cornegy, Jr., whose district includes Bedford- Stuyvesant, stated his opposition to the sales in a Dec. 3 tweet : “I have spoken out against tax lien sales often. They should be canceled because raising revenue off of
        the suffering of homeowners is too high of a price to pay. We cannot get our revenue streams on the backs of homeowners.”
      </p>
      <p>The bill would freeze the sale of liens on all one-, two- or three-family homes with assessed values under $250,000 for 2021. Property owners must have made less than $150,000 in 2020 and prove direct COVID-19-related hardship to the
        Department of Finance for them to qualify for exclusion from the lien list. According to realtor.com, a real estate and home-purchasing site, homes for sale in Bedford-Stuyvesant ranged from $285,000 to over $400,000 in 2020.

      <p>Homeowners are eager to meet their financial obligations and only renege because of financial difficulties, said Jacquelyn Griffin, an attorney at Brooklyn Legal Services.
      </p>
      <p>“I think it’s much more important to our neighbors that we demonstrate urgency in helping them through this crisis,” said Griffin at the public hearing. “And the best way to do that would be to not rubber-stamp the process of the lien sale,
        which we have acknowledged is not working.”
      </p>
      <p> Richard Flateau, the chairperson of the Brooklyn community board 3, said in an interview that he believes that abolishing the sale of tax liens could help prevent future deed fraud. Deed fraud occurs when a homeowner is made to believe the
        documents being signed offer financial assistance, but it turns out they are signing away their property deed.
      </p>
      <p> “When the [tax lien] list gets published, unscrupulous investors can look at the list and see that people may be in financial difficulties and target them for fraud schemes,” said Flateau, who almost became a victim of deed fraud in 2016.
      </p>
      <p> Jacques Jiha, the budget director of the NYC office of management and budget, conceded that some people may get hurt because of the list, but he said that the city needs the revenue to fill a $2.8 billion budget gap for the current fiscal
        year ending June 30, 2021.
      </p>
      <p>“On the one hand, we understand all the concerns with the tax lien sale and we’re going to make sure we have plans so we could help these people,” said Jiha. “At the same time, we need resources to help those people.”
      </p>
      <p>According to the Department of Finance, the 2019 lien sale of overdue city taxes and fines yielded more than $120 million.
      </p>
      <p> There are no plans for the bill to move into the floor of the full council as of yet.
